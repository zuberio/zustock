ZUSTOCK
===

Zustock is a RepRap Delta printer.

The design is heavily inspired by the fantastic Rostock, Kossel, 3DR, and Boots Industries 3D printers.

It's a work in progress - I'm still waiting for parts to ship to me before actually building it.

The files here are provided for you to print, build, experiment and evolve the design however you choose, please share your experiences and modifications and let me know if you build one.

##### 3D Print Settings
Herringbone Gears<br/>
- Layer height = 0.3 mm<br/>
- Perimeters = 1<br/>
- Top/bottom solid layers = 1<br/>
- Infill density = 90% <br/>
- You'll need really good cooling to do the base of the small gear properly. When the large gear is finished, crank your fan up to max, perhaps convince your slicer to slow it down a little too.<br/>

Everything else<br/>
- Layer height = 0.3 mm<br/>
- Perimeters = 3<br/>
- Top/bottom solid layers = 3<br/>
- Infill density = 50% <br/>

More to come...
