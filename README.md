##### Instructions

Herringbone Gears (By Triffid Hunter - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10707)
- This is a detailed part (due to the tooth profiles) so use your smallest nozzle.
- Print in PLA, it will last a lot longer due to being harder than ABS.
- Set 0 extra shells (skeinforge)/ 1 perimeter (slic3r) because you can get hollow teeth with extra shells/perimeters.
- Use 80-90% infill. I've already removed lots of plastic, what's left is what's needed. If your infill is too low, the most likely failure is the nut trap in the small gear will break.
- You'll need really good cooling to do the base of the small gear properly. When the large gear is finished, crank your fan up to max, perhaps convince your slicer to slow it down a little too.

Everything else (Based on Kossel Mini recommended print settings)
- Layer height = 0.2 to 0.3 mm (around 60% of your nozzle size)
- Perimeters = 3
- Top/bottom solid layers = 3
- Infill density = 50%

##### Description
ZUSTOCK
===

Zustock is a RepRap Delta printer. Designed by Omar Zuberi (Aka zuberio)

The design is highly inspired by the fantastic Rostock, Kossell, 3DR, and Boots Industries 3D printers.

It's a work in progress - I'm still waiting for parts to ship to me before building it.

The files here are provided for you to print, build, experiment and evolve the design how you choose, please share your experiences and modifications and do let me know if you build one.
