ZUSTOCK
===

Zustock is a RepRap Delta printer.

The design is heavily inspired by the fantastic Rostock, Kossel, 3DR, and Boots Industries 3D printers.

It's a work in progress - I'm still waiting for parts to ship to me before actually building it.

The files here are provided for you to print, build, experiment and evolve the design however you choose, please share your experiences and modifications and let me know if you build one.

##### Credits
Many people and projects have provided inspiration for this printer design. I would like to thank everyone working on RepRap projects the world over. 
Special thanks to - 

Johann C. Rocholl for all the amazing work on the Rostock and Kossel Mini Delta printers and Delta printer firmware.

##### 3D Print Settings
Herringbone Gears (By Triffid Hunter - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10707)<br/>
- This is a detailed part (due to the tooth profiles) so use your smallest nozzle.<br/>
- Print in PLA, it will last a lot longer due to being harder than ABS.<br/>
- Set 0 extra shells (skeinforge)/ 1 perimeter (slic3r) because you can get hollow teeth with extra shells/perimeters.<br/>
- Use 80-90% infill. I've already removed lots of plastic, what's left is what's needed. If your infill is too low, the most likely failure is the nut trap in the small gear will break.<br/>
- You'll need really good cooling to do the base of the small gear properly. When the large gear is finished, crank your fan up to max, perhaps convince your slicer to slow it down a little too.<br/>

Everything else (Based on Kossel Mini recommended print settings)<br/>
- Layer height = 0.2 to 0.3 mm (around 60% of your nozzle size)<br/>
- Perimeters = 3<br/>
- Top/bottom solid layers = 3<br/>
- Infill density = 50% <br/>

More to come...
